# Introduction

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). This project is focused on the prices of resale flats in Singapore over time

# Problem Statement

Singapore is a bustling city-state with a high demand for housing. However, not everyone can afford to purchase a brand new property in this expensive city. That's where resale flats come in. Resale flats offer an alternative option for individuals looking to own a home in Singapore. 

***But when is the best time to buy a resale flat in Singapore?***

# Data

All resale flats sale prices from 1990 - 2023

(Taken from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices))

# Data focus point for machine learning

As there is alot of data we decided to focus on the top 3 towns with the most flats. The top three towns and blocks with the most data is

1. Tampines Block 267

2. Bedok Block 534

3. Yishun Block 107

# Machine Learning Models Used

1. [Linear regression](https://github.com/Tzsds/SC1015/blob/main/ML(Linear%20Regression).ipynb)

2. [Neural Network](https://github.com/Tzsds/SC1015/blob/main/ML(Neural%20Network).ipynb)

# Conclusion

The price of resale flats will rise as time goes on and many factors can affect that price such as the facilities around it. Therefore in order to answer the question when is the best time to purchase a resale flat we would have to carefully analyze the behaviour of those prices over the years in order to make the best choice.

# What have we learnt from this project

-How to use neural networks to predict the future prices

-How to use tensorflow

-Prices can be affected by many factors that are not about the flat itself
