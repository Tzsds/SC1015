# Problem Statement

Singapore is a bustling city-state with a high demand for housing. However, not everyone can afford to purchase a brand new property in this expensive city. That's where resale flats come in. Resale flats offer an alternative option for individuals looking to own a home in Singapore. ***But when is the best time to buy a resale flat in Singapore?***

# Data

All resale flats sale prices from 1990 - 2023

# Data focus point

As there is alot of data we only chose to focus on the top 3 towns with the most flats

# Machine Learning Models Used

1. [Linear regression](https://github.com/Tzsds/SC1015/blob/main/ML(Linear%20Regression).ipynb)

2. [Neural Network](https://github.com/Tzsds/SC1015/blob/main/ML(Neural%20Network).ipynb)
